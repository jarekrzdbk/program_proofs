It is important to reconstruct molecule from the \textit{asymmetric unit} (AU) preserving stoichiometric ratios. To handle this task program \textit{cif\_molecule}\cite{Grazulis2015} were developed as part of \textit{cod-tools} package.

There are special kind of molecules, \textit{polymeric} molecules. Technical term is \textit{coordination polymers}, and there is a long history of problems with definitions \cite{Batten1998, Batten2012, Batten2013}. For our purposes we will consider \textit{polymer} an infinite molecule, which can be represented by an infinite repeated net. Infinite nature of \textit{polymers} presents problem on how to create a finite representation of such molecule.
There is an algorithm\cite{Chung1984} to solve this problem. It uses \textit{quotient graph} to describe all translational equivalent bonds and atoms. \textit{Quotient graph} algorithm uses notion of \textit{equivalence} to group \textit{equivalent} objects, in our case atoms are \textit{equivalent} if they have the same \textit{label} and \textit{symmetry operation} and algorithm will collect all \textit{equivalent} atoms into groups and add connections (edges) between them, we assign value to the edges.

Algorithm to create \textit{Labeled Quotient Graph} (LQG):

\begin{enumerate}\itemsep0pt
    \item Choose a coordinate system, select basis vectors.
    \item Assign initial labels to the original vertices $(0,0,0)$.
    \item If the net has an edge from point $P(m,n)$ to point $R(p,q)$ $\Rightarrow$ there is a directed edge in \textit{LQG} with label $(p-m, q-n)$ from $P$ to $R$.
\end{enumerate}

On the left you can see \textit{honycomb} net, at the center is a visual representation of the construction of \textit{LQG} and on the right is the result --- \textit{LQG}, vertex \textit{B\_1} represents all the \textit{Boron} atoms with symmetry operation 1, and vertex \textit{N\_2} represents all the \textit{Nitrogen} atoms with symmetry operation 2, 3 edges between these vertices represent all the possible translations that atoms can take, and can be used to reconstruct molecule.

\textit{LQG} algorithm was implemented in \textit{cif\_molecule} and released in \textit{cod-tools} release \textit{3.11.0}\cite{cod-tools}. \textit{cif\_molecule} were used on all the entries in the \textit{Crystallography Open Database} (COD)\cite{Grazulis2011}.

In addition to multiple tests that were already present, number of tests were added to the \textit{cif\_molecule}. But it is impossible to predict all the possible test cases. This potentially makes this algorithm a good target for creating formal specification that can be proved and improve confidence in the algorithm.

Dafny is a powerful language and a automated program verifier with rich set of features. Unfortunately only simplified version of the algorithm was implemented, and proof is rudimentary. It is hard to come up with a proper postconditions and the proof. Additional method to reconstruct molecule from \textit{LQG} was implemented but it is very simplified, and does not follows the original algorithm.
After more practice and exposure to formal methods I think I will be able to improve my implementation.
